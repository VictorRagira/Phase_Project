# Phase_Project

This project's primary goal is to assist Microsoft in entering the movie industry by establishing a new movie studio. Microsoft currently lacks the necessary knowledge and insights regarding successful film genres that attract both substantial box office earnings and positive audience feedback. The aim is to analyze movie data comprehensively to deliver valuable insights that will help Microsoft make informed decisions about the types of films they should produce.
